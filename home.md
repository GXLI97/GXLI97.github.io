Hello! My name is Gene Li. I'm a third year PhD student at the [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago](https://ttic.edu/), where I'm advised by [Nathan Srebro](https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~nati/). I also work with [Cong Ma](https://congma1028.github.io) at UChicago Stats.

I'm broadly interested in theoretical machine learning and decision making. Recently, I have been thinking about function approximation for decision making settings like contextual bandits and reinforcement learning, with the goal of characterizing the fundamental limits for these problems and understanding new algorithmic paradigms. 

In Fall 2020, I was a visiting graduate student at the [Theory of Reinforcement Learning](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/rl20) program at the [Simons Institute](https://simons.berkeley.edu). Previously, I graduated with a BSE from the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.princeton.edu) department at [Princeton University](http://www.princeton.edu). There, I had the pleasure of working with [Yuxin Chen](http://www.princeton.edu/~yc5/) and [Emmanuel Abbe](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~eabbe/).

If you want to get in touch, you can reach me at: [gene at ttic dot edu].
