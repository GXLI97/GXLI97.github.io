Hello! My name is Gene Li. I'm a second year PhD student at the [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago](https://ttic.edu/), where I'm advised by [Nathan Srebro](https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~nati/). I'm broadly interested in theoretical machine learning.

I graduated with a BSE from the [Electrical Engineering](https://ee.princeton.edu/) department at Princeton University. There, I had the pleasure of working with [Yuxin Chen](http://www.princeton.edu/~yc5/) and [Emmanuel Abbe](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~eabbe/).

If you want to get in touch, you can reach me at: [gene at ttic dot edu].
